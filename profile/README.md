## Mario Kart Mod Manager & Retro Rewind Auto Updater

Wheel Wizard, our mod manager, is created for the sole purpose of convenience. Technically, these mods and Retro Rewind are all doable without this app, but this app makes it possible with just a few clicks. It still has a lot of features in the planning stage and is fully in development, so keep an eye out for updates.

## Free and Open Source

Wheel Wizard was made by [patchzy](https://github.com/patchzyy) and [wanttobeeme](https://github.com/wanttobeeme). This application is completely free to use. You can go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard/releases) and download the executable there. Once installed, the app will automatically notify you when updates are available.

Feel free to join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vZ7T2wJnsq) for support and discussions! If you see any bugs, this is also the place to be :P
