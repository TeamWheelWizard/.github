## Mario Kart Mod Manager & Retro Rewind Auto Updater

Wheel Wizard, our mod manager, is created for the sole purpose of convenience. Technically, these mods and Retro Rewind are all doable without this app, but this app makes it possible with just a few clicks. It still has a lot of features in the planning stage and is fully in development, so keep an eye out for updates.

## Free and Open Source

Wheel Wizard was made by [patchzy](https://github.com/patchzyy) and [wanttobeeme](https://github.com/wanttobeeme). This application is completely free to use. You can go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard/releases) and download the executable there. Once installed, the app will automatically notify you when updates are available.

Feel free to join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vZ7T2wJnsq) for support and discussions! If you see any bugs, this is also the place to be :P

## Antivirus Warning

### False Positive Detections

Some antivirus software, including Windows Defender, may incorrectly flag Wheel Wizard as a virus or trojan. 
This is a common issue with new software releases and is known as a "false positive." 
Rest assured, Wheel Wizard is safe to use.

### Why This Happens

- Antivirus programs sometimes mistakenly identify new or less common software as potentially harmful.
- These false detections can vary between different antivirus programs and even between scans.
- The inconsistency in these detections (e.g., being labeled as both a "virus" and a "trojan") further indicates that these are likely false positives.

### What You Can Do

1. **Ensure you're using the latest version** of Wheel Wizard, as we continually work to address these issues.
2. If you encounter a warning, you can submit the Wheel Wizard executable to Microsoft for analysis [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission). This helps improve detection accuracy.
3. You may need to add an exception for Wheel Wizard in your antivirus software to prevent it from interfering with the application.
4. If you dont trust us, you may either build the program yourself (we have included a build.bat in our source code)
5. Or you can run the program through [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and see it will pass 99% of checks
   
### What We're Doing About It

- We're actively working on submitting each release to Microsoft and other antivirus vendors for review.
- This process should help reduce false positive detections in future scans.
- We're exploring options for code signing, which may help prevent these issues in the long term.

### Trust and Verification

We understand that security is paramount when downloading software. We encourage users to:

- Verify that you're downloading Wheel Wizard from our official GitHub repository.
- Check the code yourself if you have concerns â€“ we're open source for a reason!
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/vZ7T2wJnsq) if you have any questions or concerns.

Remember, while we assure you of our software's safety, it's always good practice to exercise caution when downloading and running new applications.
